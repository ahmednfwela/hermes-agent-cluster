"""#878: a main restart must not silently strand the queue.

Scheduling is driven purely by task-lifecycle events -- created, capabilities
updated, completed -- each calling ``trigger_pending_tasks()`` exactly once. A
task still `ready` when the process dies has spent its only trigger, so the
next process loads it from the store and never asks the scheduler about it
again. Node re-registration does not rescue it: the trigger in
``routers/nodes.py`` lives in ``update_capabilities``, not in join/heartbeat.

Measured on the hosted main 2026-09-12: a ``requires: ["tooling"]`` task sat
`ready` for 3+ minutes after a pod restart with three workers online at
``load 0.0`` and zero rows in ``scheduling_decisions``; one manual
``POST /api/v1/schedule/trigger`` dispatched it in under 15s.

The failure is silent -- no error, no fail_reason, ``failed_schedules`` stays
0 -- and in Kubernetes a restart happens on any drain, image bump or eviction.
