"""Regression tests for shared/claude-plugins#871 — false failure of a lane
that delivered by printing its final message.

#868 moved the child's inherited stdout from result.md to
``<task>.stdout.log`` and left result.md free — correct for its own bug, but
lanes deliver by PRINTING their final message. Pre-#868 the print WAS
result.md and reaped done; post-#868 the lane must write result.md explicitly,
and #868 refused any transcript promotion — so a lane that did everything
right reaped ``no_result`` → ``_report_failure``. Measured twice on the same
lane (the captured specimens in ``fixtures.specimens_871``):
task_b6130afa6be27c64 and task_1c15d3876544db7a both posted PASS verdicts on
devops/aggregate!280 (notes 135356 / 135349) with full transcripts and no
result.md — and both were recorded FAILED, feeding an unbounded re-dispatch
loop.

The fix (option 3 in the issue):

1. The wrapper makes the delivery contract EXPLICIT in every hermes-mode
   brief: the exact result.md path, written down, with the instruction to
   write it.
2. Reap falls back to the transcript under the narrow rule (rc=0, no
   result.md, non-empty stdout.log, no stranded .hermes-tmp.* from this
   delivery — the last condition already holds structurally because the
   stranded check runs FIRST and returns), and the promotion is VISIBLE:
   - the outcome is ``transcript_promoted``, never plain ``done``, and
   - result.md is written with a loud machine-checkable marker header.

Nothing here is OS-specific: every test in this file runs on every platform.
The #868 guards are asserted as CONTROLS (a real deliverable still reaps
done; the stranded-tmp and rc!=0 paths still reap loudly) so the fix cannot
reopen the false-success hole it is closing the false-failure side of.
